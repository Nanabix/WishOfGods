She's not okay, right?#speaker:Marvin #portrait:Marvin_neutral #layout:right

Some oils?

I have a new medicine we could try.

+ Did you see that story teller in Town? He is usually in the Tavern.#speaker:Yuru #portrait:Yuru_neutral #layout:left
Who? #speaker:Marvin #portrait:Marvin_neutral #layout:right
Do you mean Jasper? 
Of course I know him! Always grumpy and these sun glasses! 
How does he even see his fingers with those? I am surprised that he knows what he's grabbin'!

+ Do you know the Legend of the God's Wish?#speaker:Yuru #portrait:Yuru_neutral #layout:left
Hmm â€¦ the one about gathering gifts of the gods and then you get one wish? #speaker:Marvin #portrait:Marvin_neutral #layout:right
Thatâ€™s Bullshit. 
There are no gods anymore, they left us long ago.
